# Analysis of Flight Delays in the US Aviation Industry

## Introduction

Flight delays are a common occurrence in the aviation industry, impacting both passengers and airlines alike. Analyzing flight delay data is crucial for understanding the factors contributing to delays and devising strategies to minimize their impact. The dataset at hand offers a comprehensive view of flight information in the United States, excluding weather-related data. This exclusion is intentional to prevent biasing delay statistics and analysis.

## Insights

- January had the most delayed flights, with an average arrival delay of 7.776 minutes and an average departure delay of 12.8 minutes.
- Frontier Airlines emerged as the worst-performing airline in the US during this period, with significantly higher delays compared to the overall average.
- The most significant factor contributing to delays across airlines was the delay caused by the arrival of the last aircraft.
- The KPIs reveal an interesting dynamic in delay cause. While the primary cause of delays across airlines is typically the arrival of the last flight, the duration of these delays is predominantly influenced by factors within the airline's control.
- At MSN airport, Frontier Airlines encountered an average departure delay of a staggering 62 minutes, highlighting a critical area for operational improvements.
- An intriguing observation is the negative correlation between departure delay and flight duration, specifically for Frontier Airlines' short haul flights.

## Conclusion

Our analysis focused on identifying the airports where Frontier Airlines experienced the most significant delays, leading us to the crucial insight that these delays primarily stem from internal factors within the airline itself. External elements like weather conditions or issues with the National Aviation System (NAS) for traffic control were not significant contributors to Frontier Airlines' delays during the analyzed period.

This finding underscores the critical importance for Frontier Airlines to concentrate efforts on enhancing internal operational efficiencies and processes. Areas such as scheduling optimization, crew management, and proactive contingency planning could greatly reduce delays and improve overall service reliability. Furthermore, the negative correlation observed between flight duration and departure delays within Frontier Airlines' short haul flights highlights a specific area for targeted improvement.

By focusing on strategies to minimize delays in short haul flights, Frontier Airlines can enhance customer satisfaction, maintain schedule adherence, and strengthen its competitive position in the aviation industry.
